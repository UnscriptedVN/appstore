# Contributing Guidelines

## Git commit messages

Commits follow a system that utilize Gitmoji. The format is as follows:

```
:gitmoji_code: Summary of action, or "Do stuff" if there's a lot of changes made in this commit.

Additional notes on what was done, if the summary cannot properly describe all of the actions.
```

For example:

```
:sparkles: Add player movement abilities

The player can now move in all four directions, and controller input is supported.
```

> :notebook: If you also have the ability to sign your commit with GPG, please do so!
